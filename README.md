# Applied-Machine-Learning
The files in this repository are part of the project for ITCS 5156: Applied Machine Learning course under Dr. Minwoo Jake Lee at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 

This project performs Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non Negative Matrix Factorization. To ensure that all the visualizations run correctly, run the notebook locally using Jupyter Notebook or on Google Colab. 

Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling that is used to discover abstract "topics" in a collection of texts.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique to extract topics from a given corpus.  It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.
NMF breaks down high-dimensional vectors into lower-dimensional vectors. As these lower-dimensional vectors are positive,Â so are their coefficients.
